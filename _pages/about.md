My name is Anant, I hold a bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (Avionics) from the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST). I have been offered a job as Scientist/Engineer-C at the Indian Space Research Organization, and will be joining in January 2021.

I was a sponsored intern at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) in Boulder USA, and I did my Bachelor’s thesis at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. At IIST, LASP, and NTU, I have worked on the design and development of multiple small satellite missions. 

At home, I have a penchant for developing electronics projects, using Raspberry Pi and other embedded system platforms. I am also proficient in playing guitar and keyboard, and I like exploring the relationship between mathematics and music theory. I am a vivid learner and I enjoy exploring scientific concepts by reading popular science books. I enjoy playing action-adventure games on my playstation, and am also a football fan and Real Madrid supporter. When possible, I cherish sports and outdoor activities, including swimming, tennis, football, hiking and star-gazing :).
