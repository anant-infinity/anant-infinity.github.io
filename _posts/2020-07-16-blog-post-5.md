This is definitely one of my favorite technical books ever. I read this book during the first year of my undergraduate course in Avionics, and it transformed the way I think about computers. 

The book starts by explaining what a "bit" is and ends with the complete architecture of an 8-bit Computer, including its CPU, ALU, etc. The book is very easy to understand and helps to build an intuition of the different components of the computer work cohesively. 

Would recommend it to all electronics/computer enthusiasts as well as to the general reader who just wants to understand how computers work.
