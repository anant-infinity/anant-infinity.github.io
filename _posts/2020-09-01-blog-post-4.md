Explains the difference between vertical thinking (digging an existing hole deeper) and lateral thinking (finding a new hole to dig). Encourages the reader to inculcate lateral thinking practices in their daily lives and motivates them to think different (apple motto reference xD).

Really enjoyed this quick read, which has numerous examples of how lateral thinking led to inventions in the past, such as Edison, Edward Jenner, Faraday, and many more. Would recommend it to everyone, especially those working in Science or Engineering research.
