The advantages of working with small satellites and particularly embedded systems are that they do not require a lot of fancy equipment. When the covid pandemic stuck, I was halfway through my final year project,  which involved the designing development of a rocket payload. Most of my work was lab-based, as I needed to develop flight software for this payload and test it on the target embedded system which was the onboard computer. 

In order to continue my project work, I set up a makeshift lab at my home using low-cost components purchased from amazon. This possed describes my test set up and I have also provided amazon links to the components. 

Following is a picture of my setup:
