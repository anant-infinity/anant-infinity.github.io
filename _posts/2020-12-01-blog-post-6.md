This book gives a concise and lucid overview of the various branches of science and their evolution. The book is organized into four parts:  

1. Part I Introduces mathematics and it's the evolution, while highlighting various interesting fields like game theory, topology, etc. 

2. Part II: Explains space, time, and general relativity. This section also has a beautiful explanation about Entropy and Time Inversion, which was super-useful to me when I watched Christopher Nolan's Tenet ( Damn, I love that movie so much may write a separate review of that later). 

3. Part III: This section titled, "Microcosmos" explains the fundamentals of biology and chemistry, and tries to answer questions regarding the Origin of Life. 

4. Part IV: The last section titled, "Macrocosmos" gives an overview of the universe and its evolution on a grand scale. 

I read this book when a favorite professor at IIST lent it to me, and I will definitely recommend this book to science enthusiasts, whether they are in high-school or university.
