My project involved designing a payload for the PSLV 4th Stage Orbital Platform (PS4-OP), 
which is a platform created by repurposing the spent fourth/final stage of the Polar Satellite Launch
Vehicle (PSLV)), to conduct in-orbit scientific experiments. The payload aims to demonstrate that, accurate
Solar Spectral Irradiance measurements are possible using new miniaturized and robust disruptive instruments.

I first developed the system architecture of the payload including the interfaces between the various subsystems,
namely, the PS4-OP adapter board, OBC, EPS, and the AS7265x spectral sensor. I then designed the schematic
and layout (using KiCAD) of the PS4-OP adapter board and performed unit tests on all the subsystem PCBs.
My major contribution was in developing the flight software for the OBC using C and implementing it on the
ARM CortexM3 microprocessor of the SmartFusion2 SoC FPGA. I developed a bare-metal schedular to
perform the sequence of operations and designed modular subsystem libraries, to allow reconfigurability for
future missions. Lastly, I conducted comprehensive performance tests and thermal-vacuum environmental test
on the payload, and developed a decoder application using Python to analyze level-0 and level-1 payload
telemetry. After the successful completion of these tests, the payload was delivered for a planned launch in
2021.

The  flight  software  for  IS0  is  written  in  C  as  a  sequential program.  The  C  code  runs  on  the  ARM  CortexM3  Micro-controller  implemented  in  the  Microsemi  SmartFusion2  SoC(System  on  Chip)  FPGA.  The  FPGA  implements  interfaces with  the  PicoSIM  sensor  board  and  the  EPS  board.  Apart from the peripherals for interfacing, custom developed verilogIP  cores  are  also  implemented  in  the  FPGA,  including  aWatchdog Timer Handler, a Real Time Counter and a LaunchVehicle  Telemetry  Handler.  The  flowchart  shown  in  figure summarizes  the  entire  flight  software  sequence  of  operationsof the payload.Immediately  after  power  ON  the  initialization  proceduretakes  place.  This  includes  initialization  of  the  various  mem-ories,  peripheral  drivers,  software  parameters  and  variables.After this the program enters into an infinite while loop wherethe  the  tasks  are  carried  out  sequentially.  First  the  externalwatchdog  peripheral  is  handled,  this  is  done  by  "petting"  the watchdog  timer  handler  Verilog  IP  core  with  toggle  signalevery 1 second. This watchdog timer is used to generate a resetto the C&DH in case the flight software doesnâ€™t generate thetoggle signal timely. Next the data from the C&DH (Commandand Data Handling Board), the EPS (Electrical Power System) and  the  PicoSIM  sensor  board  is  collected  using  differentperipherals.  Then  this  data  is  converted  it  into  the  CCSDSbeacon  packet  format  and  stored  in  the  non-volatile  flashmemory  of  the  SoM.  The  data  packet  is  stored  in  the  SDcard  and  also  read  back  from  it  to  verify  the  working  of  theSD  card.  Once  the  data  packet  is  formed,  it  is  copied  to  thelaunch vehicle telemetry handler verilog core implemented inthe  FPGA.  The  telemetry  handler  then  sends  the  data  packetto the launch vehicle when commanded
