My project involved designing a payload for the PSLV 4th Stage Orbital Platform (PS4-OP), 
which is a platform created by repurposing the spent fourth/final stage of the Polar Satellite Launch
Vehicle (PSLV)), to conduct in-orbit scientific experiments. The payload aims to demonstrate that, accurate
Solar Spectral Irradiance measurements are possible using new miniaturized and robust disruptive instruments.
